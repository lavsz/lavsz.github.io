Instructor at Flatiron - Amber Yandom mentioned that you can find almost any infomation you need if you are looking at the correct may. 

As open data becomes a more popular concept there days, we are able to obtain different types of maps easily. For this Module 2 project, I was able to obtain some interesting geospatial information from the King's County GIS Open Data website. Ranging from demographic to school districts, from natural hazards to public transit, there are many geospatial dataset available. 

Geospatial data can be available in many different types of format including:
* Points
* Line
* Polygon

The above features are usually coming in as vector data. Another commonly used geospatial format is raster data. If you are interested in figuring out more about what is raster data, here's a very good webage to check out from Esri ([link](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-raster-data.htm) 

As you are aware, besides the software solution such as ArcGIS (licensed) and QGIS (open source), there are some libriaries in Python can assist you to look at geospatial data formating and analysing. Some very useful ones include the following: 
* GeoPandas
* Fiona
* Shapely
* Rtree
* Pysal

When it comes to producing a visualization (aka. a map), there are more and more visualization libraries support spatial graphs including: 
* Folium
* Plotly
* Bokeh
* Matplotlib
